The goal is to discover which Toronto neighborhood would be best-suited for a new coffee shop. We will use the data available from Foursquare to determine which area most has an ideal combination of a high population (potential customers) and a low number of coffee shops (potential rivals). Whichever neighborhood can claim to possess both these traits to the greatest degree we will determine to be the ideal new coffee shop location. This information should be highly useful to those seeking to establish a coffee shop in Toronto.
